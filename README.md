This 4-week program focused on providing practical skills in AI and Cloud Computing. It was structured with weekly virtual sessions, mentor guidance, and hands-on labs. The curriculum included:

Week 1: Internship Orientation, IBM Cloud Registration, Artificial Intelligence.
Week 2: Data Analytics concepts, Hands-On Labs, and Cloud EDA.
Week 3 & 4: Building a Chat Bot, AI/ML experiments on the cloud, and a deep dive into AutoAI experiments on IBM Cloud.
Successful completion required active participation, completion of at least two courses on IBM SkillsBuild, and the submission of a final project presentation. 


## Project Overview

## Features

* Answers financial queries in simple language
* Creates monthly budgets based on user input
* Tracks expenses by category (e.g., food, utilities)
* Offers saving tips based on spending habits
* Summarizes financial documents uploaded
* Searches the web for trusted financial knowledge (via integrated tools)

***

## Use Case Examples

### Quick Start Questions:

2. Can you help me create a monthly budget?
3. How much have I spent on food this month?
4. What are some ways I can save money based on my expenses?

## &#x20;AI Limitations & Safety

* **No legal/tax/investment advice**
* Does **not** process sensitive information like bank login details
* Avoids hallucinations by relying only on:

  * Uploaded user documents
  * Integrated tools (web search, Wikipedia, etc.)
  * Verified built-in financial knowledge
* Uses **plain English** and explains jargon when used

***

## &#x20;Technical Setup

### IBM Watsonx Configuration:

* **Model**: `mistral-large`
* **Architecture**: AI Agent with conversational UI
* **Tools Added**:

  * Google Search
  * DuckDuckGo Search
  * Wikipedia Search
  * Webcrawler
  * \[Optional] Upload tool (if enabled)

***

## &#x20;Deployment

### Accessing the Deployed Assistant:

If deployed using IBM watsonx.ai:

* Youâ€™ll get a **Deployment URL** like this:

  ```
  bash
  ```

  CopyEdit

  `https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4/deployments/<deployment-id>/ai_service?version=2021-05-01 `&#x20;

> ðŸ”— This is **not** a direct public-facing link. To make the agent usable as a public-facing assistant, embed it in a web app or create an API wrapper around it.

## Exporting the Project to GitHub

You can use **IBM Cloud CLI** or manual methods:

1. **CLI (IBM Cloud Shell)**:

   ```
   bash
   ```
 `ibmcloud login ibmcloud ml deployment-download --deployment-id <your-id> git init git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/SmartFinance-Assistant.git git add . git commit -m "Initial commit" git push -u origin main `&#x20;
2. **Manual**:

   * Download assets and model files from `Assets` in IBM watsonx
   * Add them to a GitHub repo manually via drag & drop or `git push`

***

## &#x20;Future Enhancements

* Integrate bank APIs (with OAuth) for real-time finance data
* Enable user-specific dashboards for reports and charts
* Add multilingual support
* Improve data privacy with end-to-end encryption for document uploads
